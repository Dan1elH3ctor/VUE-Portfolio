    <p>
      I am a self-taught artist and have experience with painting, drawing, sculpting and woodcarving. My interest in coding started when I     
      realized i could combine my physical artistic talents and digitize them, whether to post as is or recreate using other programmes. This has 
      pushed me to explore digital drawing/painting and gif making. Exploring my interests in this field led me to wanting to create games using my
      own art.
